# Reflection 1.2

The reason why "Adhis's Computer: hey hey" prints first is due to the sequencing and behavior of task execution in the Rust code. Initially, the "hey hey" message is printed directly in the ```main()``` function, which executes operations synchronously on the main thread. Following this, a task is spawned using ```spawner.spawn``` that includes asynchronous operations like waiting for a timer and printing additional messages. However, this task is simply enqueued and doesn't execute immediately because the executor that processes these tasks hasnâ€™t started yet. The executor begins its operation only after the spawner is dropped and the ```executor.run()``` command is executed. Therefore, the direct print statement executes before any tasks in the queue have started, resulting in "hey hey" being printed first, followed by the other messages as the executor processes the asynchronous task.
